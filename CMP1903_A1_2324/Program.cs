/*<Harry Paul> code review:
* code has all functions listed in brief including the optional tasks
* There is a slight logical error in that the die class only rolls between  and 5 due to 
* random.next excluding the end value
* 
* code follows the style guidelines with methods and variables being in the appropriate cases
* and comments formatted correctly
*
* code is easy to read and is thoroughly commented
*
* code handles erroneous inputs from users and prompts them to input something valid
*
* in summary I see no issues with the code. Good Job!
